# Fantastic-Game
This is the my first Tic Tac Toe  game project.
This project cotains many features like this:
Developed a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing interactive UI and game logic for an engaging user experience.
Implemented game logic  (Minimax algorithm or simple heuristics) to enable double-player.
Optimized for responsiveness and performance, ensuring smooth gameplay across different devices and screen sizes.
